Light stains of grease are still ok, but a pizza box that is heavily soiled with grease and food residue goes into the trash. If only the base is heavily soiled, it can be disposed of separately in the residual waste and the lid in waste paper. Be careful with cardboard that is coated with plastic on the inside: it belongs in the yellow bin (free of any coarse food residue)."

    "text-1": "The dual systems collect approximately 6.2 million tons of packaging waste in Germany annually. To ensure that the raw materials used in packaging production are not lost after the packaging is used, the packaging waste is sent for recycling. Behind this is the principle of the circular economy, which aims to preserve raw materials through methods such as reuse and material recovery, with minimal use of resources such as energy or water. An ideal state is a closed loop where materials can be fully recycled, eliminating disposal of waste. Instead, waste is collected, sorted, sent for recycling, and used again. Specialized and certified companies recycle waste using advanced and efficient machines. We will show you how different raw materials are recycled and where recycled materials can be found.",

    "title-2": "Why is Metal Recycling Meaningful?",
    "text-2": "In the circular economy, metals are preserved and reused as secondary raw materials after recycling. Modern processes in metal recycling save valuable resources and protect the environment. Aluminum recycling, for example, saves up to 95 percent of the energy required for primary production. About 75 percent of the currently in use aluminum comes from recycling processes.",

      "text-3": "Primary aluminum is obtained from the ore bauxite. However, an increasing amount of the raw material is recovered through the recycling of used products. In Germany, over half of the produced aluminum is made from aluminum scrap. Recycling this material saves up to 95 percent of the energy required for primary production. Aluminum can be recycled repeatedly without a loss of quality for new products and packaging."

Steel packaging can be recycled indefinitely. The recycling rate is well above 90 percent. Thus, in Germany, the material cycle for this material is closed."

Unfortunately, too many recyclable materials still end up in residual waste. Consistent waste separation can significantly reduce the amount of residual waste. Your advantage: If you separate your waste better and throw less waste into the residual waste bin, you can reduce your waste disposal fees by switching to smaller or fewer residual waste bins.",
